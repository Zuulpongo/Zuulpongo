## Yo

* I am a primarily self-taught programmer.
* I am experienced with the programming languages Zig, C, C++, Java, and Lua (I have touched on various other languages from time to time).
* I have also used luau (an extension of Lua) in Roblox Studio to create experiences.
* I hate web development.
* I am particularly interested in game development and the design of programming languages.
