## Hey ðŸ‘‹

I am a primarily self-taught casual programmer. 
I am experienced with the Zig, C++, and Lua programming languages. 
I have also used luau (an extension of Lua) in Roblox Studio to create experiences. 
I am particularly interested in game development and the design of programming languages.
